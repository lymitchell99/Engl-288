# Manifesto for poverty and education in the United States

The United States is a mixed economy primarily characterized as a capitalist and socialist society. This style of economy has advanced our country to become one of the most innovative, prominent, and leading developed nations across the world. However, despite our achievements, there are people that fall victim to poverty.

Poverty exists in the United States and has many descriptions; it can be not having a job, fear of what the future holds or simply a lack of resources (such as proper healthcare, food, clothes and shelter). From some perspectives, poverty can be a trap that affects communities over generations. Children that live in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it can be because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford sufficient academic support or families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children can grow up unable to provide for their own families, thus the generational cycle of poverty exists.

So, what causes poverty? According to [World Vision](https://www.worldvision.org/sponsorship-news-stories/global-poverty-facts) , the root causes of poverty are not only a lack of resources but are due to a variety of reasons; gender or ethnic discrimation, poor governance, exploitation or even domestic violence.

I believe that every child deserves to have a quality education. With a strong educational background, I believe that every child in poverty will have a fair chance to escape it and have the potential to make communities a more safer and inclusive place.

The first step toward a quality education is to invest and revolutionize the U.S. K-12 academic curriculum. This step includes developing financial literacy courses, providing quality educational technologies, career development, college readiness and planning, mentorship programs, mental health practices and more. Expanding and creating these resources can strongly equip students to succeed in life and can provide an environment that is equitable for all students no matter their background.

Public schools should help mold children into becoming the best versions of themselves and ensure they are ready to tackle whatever is after post-graduation of the K-12 curriculum. With this investment into education, all children will have a fair chance at life and one day they will be the ones who eradicate other problems our world faces.
